## Dota 2 Replay Parser for Private Lobby Games ( Features are still being developed )

### Project Overview

This project is a Node.js + TypeScript application designed to parse Dota 2 .dem replay files and extract detailed information from private lobby games. The parser captures various game metrics, including player statistics, team performance, and key events. It is particularly useful for tracking private 5v5 Dota 2 matches that are not recorded in the Steam database.
